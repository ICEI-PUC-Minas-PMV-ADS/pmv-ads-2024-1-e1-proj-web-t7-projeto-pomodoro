# Methodology

This section describes the organization of the team for the execution of project tasks and the tools used for the maintenance of codes and other artifacts.


## Project Management
The agile methodology chosen for the development of this project was SCRUM, because as mentioned by Amaral, Fleury and Isoni (2019, 68), its benefits are the rapid adaptation to changes, greater transparency in the process and continuous delivery of customer value.

### Roles Division

The team uses Scrum as the basis for defining the development process.

- Scrum Master: Rafael de Almeida Chaia Toledo
- Product Owner: Felipe de Souza Montes
- Development Team: Rafael de Almeida Chaia Toledo, Bruno Monteiro Lima, Felipe de Souza Montes, Heitor Santos Alves, Pablo de Araujo de Santo, Raynan Fernandes Castro Silva Rodrigues, Daniel de Paulo de Oliveira
- Design Team: Rafael de Almeida Chaia Toledo, Raynan Fernandes Castro Silva Rodrigues

### Process

To organize the project tasks, the team is using the Trello tool, structured with the following activities:

- Backlog: receives the tasks to be worked and represents the Product Backlog. All activities identified in the course of the project should also be incorporated into this list. 
- To Do: This list represents the Sprint Backlog. This is the current Sprint we are working on. 
- Doing: When a task has been started, it is moved here. 
- Done: in this list are placed the tasks that have passed the tests and quality control and are ready to be delivered to the user. No more edits or revisions required, it is scheduled and ready for action.
